</p>
<p><h3>Bindings:</h3>
     The binding argument specifies a sequence of one or more event
     patterns, with optional white space between the patterns. Each event
     pattern may take one of three forms. In the simplest case it is a
     single printing ASCII character, such as a or [. The character may
     not be a space character or the character &lt;. This form of pattern
     matches a KeyPress event for the particular character. The second
     form of pattern is longer but more general. It has the following
     syntax.
<pre>&lt;modifier-modifier-type-detail&gt;
</pre>
     The entire event pattern is surrounded by angle brackets. Inside the
     angle brackets are zero or more modifiers, an event type, and an
     extra piece of information (detail) identifying a particular button
     or keysym. Any of the fields may be omitted, as long as at least one
     of type and detail is present. The fields must be separated by white
     space or dashes (dashes are prefered). The third form of pattern is
     used to specify a user-defined, named virtual event. It has the
     following syntax.
<pre>&lt;&lt;name&gt;&gt;
</pre>
     The entire virtual event pattern is surrounded by double angle
     brackets. Inside the angle brackets is the user-defined name of the
     virtual event. Modifiers, such as Shift or Control, may not be
     combined with a virtual event to modify it. Bindings on a virtual
     event may be created before the virtual event is defined, and if the
     definition of a virtual event changes dynamically, all windows bound
     to that virtual event will respond immediately to the new
     definition. Some widgets (e.g. menu and text) issue virtual events
     when their internal state is updated in some ways. Please see the
     documentation for each widget for details.

             <tr><td>&lt;Mod2&gt; <br> &lt;M2&gt; <br> &lt;Option&gt;</td><td>Second modifier key.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;Mod3&gt; <br> &lt;M3&gt;</td><td>Third modifier key.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;Mod4&gt; <br> &lt;M4&gt;</td><td>Fourth modifier key.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;Mod5&gt; <br> &lt;M5&gt;</td><td>Fifth modifier key.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;Quadruple&gt;</td><td>Modifier for doing something four times.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;Shift&gt;</td><td>The Shift key.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;Triple&gt;</td><td>Modifier for doing something three times.</td></tr>
         </table>
     </p>
     Where more than one value is listed, the values are equivalent. Most
     of the modifiers have the obvious meanings. For example, Button1
     requires that button 1 be depressed when the event occurs. For a
     binding to match a given event, the modifiers in the event must
     include all of those specified in the event pattern. An event may
     also contain additional modifiers not specified in the binding. For
     example, if button 1 is pressed while the shift and control keys are
     down, the pattern <b>&lt;Control-Button-1&gt;</b> will match the
     event, but <b>&lt;Mod1-Button-1&gt;</b> will not. If no modifiers are
     specified, then any combination of modifiers may be present in the
     event.
<br><br>

     Meta and M refer to whichever of the M1 through M5 modifiers is
     associated with the Meta key(s) on the keyboard. If there are no
     Meta keys, or if they are not associated with any modifiers, then
     Meta and M will not match any events. Similarly, the Alt modifier
     refers to whichever modifier is associated with the alt key(s) on
     the keyboard.
<br><br>

     The Double, Triple and Quadruple modifiers are a convenience for
     specifying double mouse clicks and other repeated events. They cause
     a particular event pattern to be repeated 2, 3 or 4 times, and also
     place a time and space requirement on the sequence: for a sequence
     of events to match a Double, Triple or Quadruple pattern, all of the
     events must occur close together in time and without substantial
     mouse motion in between. For example, <b>&lt;Double-Button-1&gt;</b>
     is equivalent to <b>&lt;Button-1&gt;&lt;Button-1&gt;</b> with the
     extra time and space requirement.
<br><br>

     The Command and Option modifiers correspond to Macintosh-specific
     modifier keys.
<br><br>

     The Extended modifier is, at present, specific to Windows. It
     appears on events that are associated with the keys on the 'extended
     keyboard'. On a US keyboard, the extended keys include the Alt and
     Control keys at the right of the keyboard, the cursor keys in the
     cluster to the left of the numeric pad, the NumLock key, the
     Break key, the PrintScreen key, and the / and Enter keys in the
     numeric keypad.

<p><h3>Event Types:</h3>
<p>         <table class="parameter-list">             <tr><td>&lt;Activate&gt; <br> &lt;Deactivate&gt;</td><td>These two events are sent to every sub-window of a toplevel when they change state. In addition to the focus Window the Macintosh platform and Windows platforms have a notion of an active window (which often has but is not required to have the focus). On the Macintosh widgets in the active window have a different appearance than widgets in deactive windows. The Activate event is sent to all the sub-windows in a toplevel when it changes from being deactive to active. Likewise the Deactive event is sent when the window's state changes from active to deactive. There are no useful percent substitutions you would make when binding to these events.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;MouseWheel&gt;</td><td>Some mice on the Windows platform support a mouse wheel which is used for scrolling documents without using the scrollbars. By rolling the wheel the system will generate MouseWheel events that the application can use to scroll. On Windows the event is always routed to the window that currently has focus (like Key events.) On Mac OS X the event is routed to the window under the pointer. When the event is received you can use the %D substitution to get the delta field for the event which is a integer value describing how the mouse wheel has moved. The smallest value for which the system will report is defined by the OS. On Windows 95 &amp; 98 machines this value is at least 120 before it is reported. However higher resolution devices may be available in the future. On Mac OS X the value is not scaled by 120 but a value of 1 corresponds to roughly one text line. The sign of the value determines which direction your widget should scroll. Positive values should scroll up and negative values should scroll down.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;KeyPress&gt; <br> &lt;KeyRelease&gt;</td><td>The KeyPress and KeyRelease events are generated whenever a key is pressed or released. KeyPress and KeyRelease events are sent to the UI element which currently has the keyboard focus.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;ButtonPress&gt; <br> &lt;ButtonRelease&gt; <br> &lt;Motion&gt;</td><td>The ButtonPress and ButtonRelease events are generated when the user presses or releases a mouse button. Motion events are generated whenever the pointer is moved. ButtonPress ButtonRelease and Motion events are normally sent to the window containing the pointer. When a mouse button is pressed the window containing the pointer automatically obtains a temporary pointer grab. Subsequent ButtonPress ButtonRelease and Motion events will be sent to that window regardless of which window contains the pointer until all buttons have been released.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;Configure&gt;</td><td>A Configure event is sent to a window whenever its size position or border width changes and sometimes when it has changed position in the stacking order.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;Map&gt; <br> &lt;Unmap&gt;</td><td>The Map and Unmap events are generated whenever the mapping state of a window changes. Windows are created in the unmapped state. Top-level windows become mapped when they transition to the normal state and are unmapped in the withdrawn and iconic states. Other windows become mapped when they are placed under control of a geometry manager (for example pack or grid). A window is viewable only if it and all of its ancestors are mapped. Note that geometry managers typically do not map their children until they have been mapped themselves and unmap all children when they become unmapped; hence in Tk Map and Unmap events indicate whether or not a window is viewable.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;Visibility&gt;</td><td>A window is said to be obscured when another window above it in the stacking order fully or partially overlaps it. Visibility events are generated whenever a window's obscurity state changes; the state field (%s) specifies the new state.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;Expose&gt;</td><td>An Expose event is generated whenever all or part of a window should be redrawn (for example when a window is first mapped or if it becomes unobscured). It is normally not necessary for client applications to handle Expose events since Tk handles them internally.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;Destroy&gt;</td><td>A Destroy event is delivered to a window when it is destroyed. When the Destroy event is delivered to a widget it is in a 'half-dead' state: the widget still exists but most operations on it will fail.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;FocusIn&gt; <br> &lt;FocusOut&gt;</td><td>The FocusIn and FocusOut events are generated whenever the keyboard focus changes. A FocusOut event is sent to the old focus window and a FocusIn event is sent to the new one. In addition if the old and new focus windows do not share a common parent 'virtual crossing' focus events are sent to the intermediate windows in the hierarchy. Thus a FocusIn event indicates that the target window or one of its descendants has acquired the focus and a FocusOut event indicates that the focus has been changed to a window outside the target window's hierarchy. The keyboard focus may be changed explicitly by a call to focus or implicitly by the window manager.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;Enter&gt; <br> &lt;Leave&gt;</td><td>An Enter event is sent to a window when the pointer enters that window and a Leave event is sent when the pointer leaves it. If there is a pointer grab in effect Enter and Leave events are only delivered to the window owning the grab. In addition when the pointer moves between two windows Enter and Leave 'virtual crossing' events are sent to intermediate windows in the hierarchy in the same manner as for FocusIn and FocusOut events.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;Property&gt;</td><td>A Property event is sent to a window whenever an X property belonging to that window is changed or deleted. Property events are not normally delivered to Tk applications as they are handled by the Tk core.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;Colormap&gt;</td><td>A Colormap event is generated whenever the colormap associated with a window has been changed installed or uninstalled. Widgets may be assigned a private colormap by specifying a -colormap option; the window manager is responsible for installing and uninstalling colormaps as necessary.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;CirculateRequest&gt; <br> &lt;ConfigureRequest&gt; <br> &lt;Create&gt; <br> &lt;MapRequest&gt; <br> &lt;ResizeRequest&gt;</td><td>A Colormap event is generated whenever the colormap associated with a window has been changed installed or uninstalled. Widgets may be assigned a private colormap by specifying a -colormap option; the window manager is responsible for installing and uninstalling colormaps as necessary. Note that Tk provides no useful details for this event type.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;Circulate&gt; <br> &lt;Gravity&gt; <br> &lt;Reparent&gt;</td><td>The events Gravity and Reparent are not normally delivered to Tk applications. They are included for completeness. A Circulate event indicates that the window has moved to the top or to the bottom of the stacking order as a result of an XCirculateSubwindows protocol request. Note that the stacking order may be changed for other reasons which do not generate a Circulate event</td></tr>
         </table>
     </p>

</p>
<p><h3>Event Details:</h3>
The last part of a long event specification is detail. In the case
     of a ButtonPress or ButtonRelease event, it is the number of a
     button (1-5). If a button number is given, then only an event on
     that particular button will match; if no button number is given,
     then an event on any button will match. Note: giving a specific
     button number is different than specifying a button
     modifier; in the first case, it refers to a button being
     pressed or released, while in the second it refers to some
     other button that is already depressed when the matching
     event occurs. If a button number is given then type may be
     omitted; if will default to ButtonPress. For example, the
     specifier <b>&lt;1&gt;</b> is equivalent to <b>&lt;ButtonPress-1&gt;</b>.
<br><br>

     If the event type is KeyPress or KeyRelease, then detail may be
     specified in the form of an X keysym. Keysyms are textual
     specifications for particular keys on the keyboard; they include all
     the alphanumeric ASCII characters (e.g. “a” is the keysym for the
     ASCII character “a”), plus descriptions for non-alphanumeric
     characters (“comma”is the keysym for the comma character), plus
     descriptions for all the non-ASCII keys on the keyboard (e.g.
     “Shift_L” is the keysym for the left shift key, and “F1” is
     the keysym for the F1 function key, if it exists). The
     complete list of keysyms is not presented here; it is available in
     other X documentation and may vary from system to system. If a
     keysym detail is given, then the type field may be omitted; it will
     default to KeyPress. For example, <b>&lt;Control-comma&gt;</b> is
     equivalent to <b>&lt;Control-KeyPress-comma&gt;</b>.

</p>
<p><h3>Virtual Events:</h3>
The following are built-in virtual events for the purposes of notification:
     <p>         <table class="parameter-list">             <tr><td>&lt;&lt;AltUnderlined&gt;&gt;</td><td>This is sent to widget to notify it that the letter it has underlined (as an accelerator indicator) with the -underline option has been pressed in combination with the Alt key. The usual response to this is to either focus into the widget (or some related widget) or to invoke the widget.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;&lt;Invoke&gt;&gt;</td><td>This can be sent to some widgets (e.g. button, listbox, menu) as an alternative to &lt;space&gt;.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;&lt;ListboxSelect&gt;&gt;</td><td>This is sent to a listbox when the set of selected item(s) in the listbox is updated.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;&lt;MenuSelect&gt;&gt;</td><td>This is sent to a menu when the currently selected item in the menu changes. It is intended for use with context-sensitive help systems.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;&lt;Modified&gt;&gt;</td><td>This is sent to a text widget when the contents of the widget are changed.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;&lt;Selection&gt;&gt;</td><td>This is sent to a text widget when the selection in the widget is changed.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;&lt;ThemeChanged&gt;&gt;</td><td>This is sent to a text widget when the ttk (Tile) theme changed.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;&lt;TraverseIn&gt;&gt;</td><td>This is sent to a widget when the focus enters the widget because of a user-driven “tab to widget” action.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>&lt;&lt;TraverseOut&gt;&gt;</td><td>This is sent to a widget when the focus leaves the widget because of a user-driven “tab to widget” action.</td></tr>
         </table>
     </p>
     The following are built-in virtual events for the purposes of unifying bindings across multiple platforms.
     <p>         <table class="parameter-list">             <tr><td>&lt;&lt;Clear&gt;&gt;</td><td>Delete the currently selected widget contents.</td></tr>

<h2><a name="UiElement.setGrab"></a>auto <span class="symbol">setGrab</span>(this T)(bool enable, bool global = false);
</h2>
<div class="declaration-description"><div class="sections"><p>This command implements simple pointer and keyboard grabs. When a grab
 is set for a particular element, it restricts all pointer events to the
 grab window and its descendants. Whenever the pointer is within the grab
 element, the pointer will behave exactly the same as if there had been
 no grab at all and all events will be reported in the normal fashion.
 When the pointer is outside the element, button presses, releases and
 mouse motion events are reported to the element, and element entry and
 exit events are ignored. The grab 'owns' the pointer: elements outside
 the grab will be visible on the screen but they will be insensitive
 until the grab is released. The tree of elements underneath the grab
 element can include windows, in which case all windows and their
 descendants will continue to receive mouse events during the grab.
</p>
<p>Two forms of grabs are possible: local and global. A local grab affects
 only the grabbing application: events will be reported to other
 applications as if the grab had never occurred. Grabs are local by
 default. A global grab locks out all applications on the screen, so that
 only the given element and its descendants of the grabbing application
 will be sensitive to pointer events (mouse button presses, mouse button
 releases, pointer motions, entries, and exits). During global grabs the
 window manager will not receive pointer events either.
<br><br>

 During local grabs, keyboard events (key presses and key releases) are
 delivered as usual: the window manager controls which application
 receives keyboard events, and if they are sent to any element in the
 grabbing application then they are redirected to the focused element.
 During a global grab all keyboard events are always sent to the grabbing
 application. The focus command is still used to determine which element
 in the application receives the keyboard events. The keyboard grab is
 released when the grab is released.

</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3><table class="parameter-list"><tr><td>bool enable</td>
<td>Whether to enable or release the grab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>bool global</td>
<td>Whether or not the grab should be global.</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Return Value</h3><p>This element to aid method chaining.

</p>
<p><h3>Caveats:</h3>
It is very easy to use global grabs to render a display completely
     unusable (e.g. by setting a grab on an element which does not
     respond to events and not providing any mechanism for releasing the
     grab).  Take extreme care when using them! For a global grab to work
     the element needs to be placed and visible on the UI. Local grabs
     are not affected by this requirement.</p>

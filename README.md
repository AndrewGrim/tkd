#tkd
**GUI toolkit for the D programming language**

---

## Overview

Tkd is a fully cross-platform GUI toolkit based on 
[Tcl/Tk](http://www.tcl.tk/). Tkd allows you to build and deploy GUI 
applications easily and with the knowledge of a consistent, native look and 
feel on every platform.

### Supported platforms

* Windows
* Linux
* Mac OSX

## Why Tcl/Tk

Tkd development was initiated based on the performance and uptake of the 
[Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) toolkit distributed as a 
standard part of the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language.  
Tkinter allows developers easy access to GUI programming with very little 
learning.  Being the _de facto_ GUI toolkit of Python has introduced more 
developers to GUI application programming and increased the popularity of the 
language as a whole. Tkd is an attempt to provide D with the same resource.

## Notes

This software is heavily in development and very much alpha quality. There 
should be a beta release soon.
